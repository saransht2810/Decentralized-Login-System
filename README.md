## Project Title
Decentralized Login System

## Project Description
The Decentralized Login System is a blockchain-based authentication mechanism that provides secure, private, and decentralized user registration and verification. Built on the Aptos blockchain, this smart contract allows users to register their identities on-chain without relying on centralized authorities.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a trustless and censorship-resistant login system that eliminates the need for traditional username-password mechanisms. By leveraging blockchain technology, users gain full control over their authentication, reducing the risk of data breaches, identity theft, and centralized control over personal information.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with dApps**: Enable seamless authentication across decentralized applications.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Incorporate additional security layers such as biometrics or hardware authentication devices.
- **Cross-Blockchain Compatibility**: Expand to support multiple blockchain ecosystems.
- **Decentralized Identity Management**: Implement features for managing decentralized identities, such as revocation and recovery.
- **Smart Contract Enhancements**: Introduce role-based access control and permission-based authentication.

## Key Features
- **On-Chain User Registration**: Users can register securely on the blockchain without third-party involvement.
- **Decentralized Authentication**: Eliminates reliance on centralized authentication providers.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: No storage of sensitive user data, reducing attack vectors.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Minimal smart contract logic for quick deployment and execution.
- **Secure Identity Verification**: Users' presence on-chain serves as proof of registration.
